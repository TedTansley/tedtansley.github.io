# About me
I am currently a Data Analyst / Engineer for the [DetroitData.org](detroitdata.org) open data portal under DETROITography and have spent years as an activist personally working to make Detroit the Mobility City. Whether it’s advocating for sidewalk repairs, safer streets, a bathroom network, reopened libraries, or something else, I'm putting my efforts into impactful change. I’m also a designated representative for my block club, where I’ve successfully pushed the city to address blight, install speed humps, and streetlights.

I also help run a casual urbanist meetup which is just a space for people to talk about cities and connect over shared interests. [Follow us on Eventbrite!](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/detroit-urbanists-85158716243)
